      <Text>
        <strong>CLOSING DATE:</strong> The closing date in the contract is <strong>ON OR ABOUT {caseObj.closingDate}</strong>. This means the closing can be anytime between {caseObj.closingDate} TO {caseObj.closingDate} if all parties agree.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <strong>MORTGAGE CONTINGENCY DATE:</strong> The mortgage commitment must be obtained by <strong>{caseObj.mortgageContingencyDate}</strong>. If you cannot obtain the commitment by {caseObj.mortgageContingencyDate} please let me know immediately so I can request an extension of this date.
      </Text>
      <Text>
        <strong>RATE LOCKS:</strong> If the client decides to "lock-in" an interest rate PLEASE MAKE SURE THE RATE LOCK IS GOOD THROUGH <strong>{caseObj.closingDate}</strong>.

        Please let me know if anything else is needed.
